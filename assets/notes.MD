---

### 9. **Specialized AI/ML for Operations/IT**

- **Courses:**
  - [edX: AIOps - Introduction to AI for IT Operations (IBM)](https://www.edx.org/course/aiops-introduction-to-ai-for-it-operations)
- **Why:** Directly relevant to smart dashboards for IT/incident management.

---

## **How to Approach Learning**

- **Start with ML/NLP basics** (Andrew Ng, NLP Specialization).
- **Learn time series and anomaly detection** for forecasting and monitoring.
- **Pick up React and backend skills** for dashboard integration.
- **Explore MLOps and cloud** for deployment and scaling.
- **Apply with projects**: Build small end-to-end apps for each feature.

---

**Tip:**  
You don’t need to do all at once—start with ML/NLP, then add frontend/backend, then deployment/cloud as you progress.
